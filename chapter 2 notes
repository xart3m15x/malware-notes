\\already know how to set up VM, so this should be short

- Host-only networking creates a separate private LAN between the host OS and the VM OS
  - commonly used for malware analysis
- Use multiple virtual machines is best!!
  - link them by a LAN but disconnected from the internet and host machine so malware is connected to a network but isn't actually connected to anything important
- Most common way to connect is a bridged network adapter or NAT mode (Network Address Translation)
- Some malware can detect if running on a VM
