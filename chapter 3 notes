- Windows doesn't know how to run DLLs automatically, so typically needs an executable to say what to do
  - Is a program you can try to force run DLLs, run:
    - rundell32.exe DLLName, Export arguments
      - Install, Uninstall
  - Can also turn DLL into an executable by modifying the PE header and changing the extension
    - wipe the IMAGE_FILE_DLL (0x2000) flag from the imported functions, but probably will crash malware
      - rundll32 DLLName, InstallService ServiceName -> net start ServiceName
- ProcMon will capture every single call, so make sure to apply filters
